The project â€œGame: The Gallows". A game written according to traditional rules. The game
has an animation of a farmer, as well as an eye-pleasing code design.
Rules of the game. Your task is to guess the word randomly selected from the list, which in
turn was created by the author of the project. If you guess, you save
the farmer's life (the author's idea). If you don't guess, then... find out the outcome by running
the programm.
- After running the programm, you read the rules again, learn the subject of the list and
immediately enter the letter. (!hint from the author! start with vowels)
- If the letters you have guessed are not in the word, they will automatically be
displayed in the list in your sight.
- You can't get a hint in this game. Only your
horizons can help you.
- After the end of the first round, you will be asked about the continuation
of the game. You have the right to choose: continue the game / go to rest and broaden
your horizons.
